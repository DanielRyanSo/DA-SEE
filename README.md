1. Read the Journals about the Sessa Empirical Estimator.
2. Convert the R codes into Python Codes (use jupyter notebook).
3. Using Simulated data (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2019.00383/full) or a real world datasets of your choice (You can obtain it in Kaggle or in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/), perform the Sessa Empircal Estimator and generate some insights.
4. The Sessa Empirical Estimator uses K-Means clustering (again recall the disadvantages of K-Means), try to substitute a different clustering algorithm, generate a new insight using the new clustering algorithm.
5. Compare your results between Sessa Empirical Estimator using K-Means, and Sessa Empirical Estimator using the clustering algorithm of your choice.
6. Deadline is this Sunday, Feb 23, 2022 at 11:59 pm
7. Do this with your thesis partner.
8. You can use any A.I. assistant.

## **ðŸ“– Overview**  
This project focuses on implementing the **Sessa Empirical Estimator (SEE)** in Python by:  
- Converting existing **R code** into **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**  
- Using **K-Means clustering** and an alternative **clustering algorithm**  
- Comparing the **results and insights** between these clustering techniques  
- Utilizing **simulated or real-world datasets** for analysis

## **ðŸ“Œ Objectives**
1. **Read & Understand**: Review research journals on the Sessa Empirical Estimator.  
2. **Convert R to Python**: Translate the provided R code into an equivalent Python implementation.  
3. **Data Analysis**: Use a dataset from **simulated data** or sources like Kaggle/ UCI Repository.  
4. **Apply Clustering**:  
   - Implement **K-Means clustering** (default in SEE).  
   - Compare it with an alternative **clustering algorithm** (e.g., Agglomerative, DBSCAN, GMM).  
5. **Compare Results**: Analyze differences between K-Means and the selected alternative method.
